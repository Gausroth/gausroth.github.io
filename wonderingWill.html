                    <h2>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>Initially I was brought on the Wondering Will project to design and develop the boss encounters within the game. However, the previous programmer did not have much experience with the Unity game engine or C# and the project lead was in the process of fixing scripts. I took on the role of lead programmer and updated every script. My first task was to rework the enemy scripts to use inheritance. This allowed me to start working on the boss encounters. I also designed and developed most of the core features of the game such as grabbable objects, player controls and interactions within the game.</p>

            <h2>Research Summary</h2>
            <p>I joined the Wondering Will project to help get it back on track as the previous programmer left. I had to update many of the scripts to make them more modular to allow the code to be reused and extended. Encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are key to any project with object-oriented programming (OOP) in mind. The use of encapsulation allows for the protection or restriction of access of objects. The use of inheritance allows for adaptability and reuse of objects and scripts. The use of polymorphism allows for adaptability as well. All these aspects of OOP increase the modularity, reusability, flexibility and scalability of the code used within the game.</p>
