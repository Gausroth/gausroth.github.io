            <p>Mythology Mayhem follows several children from different ancient civilizations on their own journeys as they fight for their beliefs. After intervention from the gods of time and space, perspectives change between 2D and 3D, changing gameplay and keeping players on their toes.</p>

                    <h2>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>Initially I was brought on the Mythology Mayhem project to complete a level in the Norse chapter of the game. Right after I joined the project the lead programmer left to join a different project, and I was forced to modify scripts used in the first chapter to make the game playable. My responsibilities were not clear and since I was unable to test the Norse level my tasks were zero. As a team we decided to get the first Chapter working so I could at least work on the Norse levels. However, the game was showcased to the publisher, and they wanted the first chapter to be released as a demo. At this time my responsibilities were clear, get the first chapter polished and ready for release. As the sole full time programmer on the project I when through everything, fixed and updated most the scripts, reimported every image, recreated every 2D animation and even added 2D lighting to some of the levels.</p>

            <h2>Research Summary</h2>
            <p>When I joined the Mythology Mayhem team a lot was done but nothing was finished. Things like sound effects and visual effects were not there. Sounds and visuals are vital to the gameâ€™s accessibility. Some individuals with visual or hearing impairments may require the sounds or visuals to play the game. The audio of the game also plays a vital role in player immersion. Having no audio or unrealistic audio can lead to the player having a negative experience.</p>
